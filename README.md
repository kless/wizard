## Suggestions

### About licenses

My suggestion is **to use MPL 2.0**, a simple copyleft license, designed to
encourage contributors to share modifications they make to your code, while
still allowing them to combine your code with code under other licenses (open or
proprietary) with minimal restrictions.

Both licenses BSD and MIT/X11 have been excluded of Gowizard because they can
not mitigate threats from software patents, and LGPL because it has not benefits
using into a language of static linking.

Here you have a description of the most important elements in every license
included in gowizard:

#### MPL 2.0

Proprietary software linking: Allowed.  
Distribution with code under another license: Allowed.  
Redistributing of the code with changes: Only under MPL.  
Compatible with GNU GPL: Yes.

#### Apache Public 2.0

Proprietary software linking: Allowed.  
Distribution with code under another license: Allowed.  
Redistributing of the code with changes: Allowed.  
Compatible with GNU GPL: Yes, with version 3 of the GPL.

#### GPL/AGPL 3.0

Proprietary software linking: Not allowed.  
Distribution with code under another license: Not allowed with software whose
license is not GNU GPL compatible.  
Redistributing of the code with changes: Only under GNU GPL/AGPL.
